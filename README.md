### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Quick Notes:
- Iâ€™m currently working on improving some of my old repos, as well as kickstarting a new project.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Julia.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on spherical CNNs for weather forecasting.

The repos I have public are usually related to something I did in my studies, I hope they are of use to others. 

Always feel free to ask me about my pinned repos. Be it to clear up their usage or to implement new features in them, I will always look forward to a chat :)
